Polarity High-Fidelity Prototype ReadMe 
Natasha K., Anika F., Gene O., Monique O. 

Tools used: 
We built our high-fidelity prototype with React Native and Expo. We used Apple’s Xcode Simulator and our own mobile devices downloaded with the ExpoGo app to test the app as we developed it. 

Operating Instructions: 
You can access our prototype on an iOS device, on an android device, or online. We recommend accessing it on an iOS device. (Note: the app is optimized for the iPhone 14.) To access the app on an iOS device: 
1) Download “Expo Client” from the App Store 
2) Login to Expo with username: afuloria@stanford.edu / password: JF37ZWTVTLbZLXpizN2U
   (^ this is a randomly generated password, we promise)
3) Open your phone browser and visit  https://expo.dev/@afuloria/Polarity?serviceType=classic&distribution=expo-go
4) Click on the rectangular purple button labeled “Open project using Expo” 
5) Source code is available at https://github.com/anikafuloria/polarity 

Hard Coded Elements: 
To create the experience of a fully functioning app, we hardcoded various information into our prototype. 
Task 1 & 2: The stories written are randomly made by us. If the user writes a story, it would not show up in the list of stories. 
Task 3: The companies for users to connect with are randomly made by us. 
Task 3: The people for users to connect with are randomly made by us. 
Some of the elements are hardcoded (not responsive on different phone screens). 

Limitations: 
Our app isn’t perfect! There are still many features yet to be implemented. 
Task 1: Reading a Story - When clicking a story to read, all stories leads to the same story
Task 1: Reading a Story - The reply button is not functional
Task 2: Writing a Story - Cannot pick an emotion that the story makes you feel. 
Task 2: Writing a Story -  There is no review page when I finish writing a story. 
Task 3: Connecting with other people - This part of the application is not implemented further than a list of people on given
Task 3: Connecting with a company - When clicking with a company to connect with, it all leads to the Dalesforce page. 
Task 3: Connecting with a company - There is no review button to check your answers before submitting
Task 3: There is no back buttons in Task 3
Overall: The profile button is not implemented
Task 2 & 3: The filters functionality is not implemented
